Only XML files tested as of Jan 9.

terminology\xml\terminology1xmloutput.txt is incorrect due to known defect of XPath support in MS .Net (id() function does not support xml:id)

Some differences found in the following if compared to other implementors results:

elementswithintext\xml\withintext2xmloutput.txt
ruby\xml\ruby3xmloutput.txt
ruby\xml\ruby4xmloutput.txt. 

- In these cases the input files might not fully meet the requirements.
